                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I have been working in the digital world for over 22 years. It all started with a camera when I was about 18 years old. Since then, I have been photographing the music and fahsion industry and working for variou artist, agencies, publishers, and fashion labels but I didnt just want to stop there. My next step, I wanted to get into programming.</p>
                
                    <p>I have always had a interest in learning to program but didnt know where to start. I looked up youtube videos, took some online lessons but I understood that if I really wanted to understand the complete foundation of programming, I needed to enroll into a program..</p>
                
                    <p>In July I enrolled into a full stack developing bootcamp at UCSD Extension and am currently over a month in and am learning the foundations of programming. Through this course I hope to add programmer to my skills I can offer my clients and possibly a job oppurtunity in the near future.</p>
